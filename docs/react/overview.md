The `@stories-js/react` package provides React component wrappers for Stories's web components, so you may easily integrate them into any React application or library. The package includes the Stories renderer implemented on React.

The benefits of using React's component wrappers over the standard web components include:
- Easily use any data types to emit custom events;
- Improved usage of any data type in properties or attributes; 

## React and TypeScript Versions Support

Stories supports `React 17+` and `TypeScript 3.7+`.
